# CS330E-Notes

This repo contains notes and examples from my CS 330e class as taught by Professor Fares at the University of Texas at Austin via Zoom (during COVID-19). 
Exam summary documents are my own, contents of class-repo is my local, changed copy of the main class repo we used in class. Most of the exercises have an "AKS" variant which is my solution to the unit tests in that same folder.
