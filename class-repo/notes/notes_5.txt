Bitwise operators are typically used  on integral values. Examples, ~, |, &, >>, <<

operators precedence: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/precedence-associativity

Example:
i = 8
j = not i & (i - 1)
assert j is True      # power of 2

i & (i - 1) will be conducted first since & has higher precedence than not, 
i.e., 1000 & 0111, and the result will be False

j = not False 

j = True
