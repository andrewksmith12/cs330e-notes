Lecture-by-lecture notes:
    10/22: Quiz 14. Itertools recreations, 
        exercises: Cycle, Count, Repeat <- Basically While loops with yields. 
    10/27: 
        Quiz 15 <- list comprehension processing happens at time of creation, tuple comprehension happens at time of execution. List is a list, tuple is a generator
        exercises: Chain, CCount
        Writing a generator function:
            Return (thing_you_want_to_yield for nested_thing in main_thing for thing_you_want_to_yield in nested_thing)
            It's structured return (yield_thing for thing in main thing for yield_thing in thing)
        In classes:
            Iterator protocol: Any iterator must implement __iter__ and __next__. __next__ will use return, not yield. __iter__ returns self, since it is an iterator.  
    10/29:  
        Quiz 16 <- Basically just comprehension of class on 10/27
        exercises: CRepeat, RangeIterator
        Range isn't an iterator, it's an iterator-like object. 
    11/3: 
        Quiz 17
        exercises: Range, CCycle
        Range function and making it cycle, etc. 
        Begin discussion of closures (outer/inner functions) See closures.pdf in notes. 
    11/5: 
        Quiz 18: local variables in class def vs global variables. 
        For closure, when you return an inner function, it keeps the locals (variables) of the outer function so that it can rely on those values. Ex. Outer(i): inner(j): return i+j return inner works. 
        Review Lambdas.py, cover decorators and their uses, Exercises: Decorators.py/DecoratorsT.py
    11/10: 
        Quiz 19: Tests on decorators and stuff covered in the previous class. 
        Exercises: Decorators1
        Examples\Cache.py <- Python optimizes code upon interpretation. When you're interacting directly in CLI, it caches -5-256 automatically. When you're running from a script, it will cache all constants used. This lecture went into how identical immutable share a memory location, but things that can change such as lists get separate memory addresses even if their contents are identical (because you can change them) 
    11/12: 
        Quiz 20: Tests on Decorators, Assignment 9 published
        Examples: Variables.py <- this basically is further explanation of cacheing/memory in python, going into lists/tuples and concatenation
        Exercises: Select.py
        Levels of computer languages:
            Low level (1st gen lang. ): Machine Code (10101010)
            Assembly Languages (2nd gen lang): very, very basic language for things like add and sub. Assembler translates it to machine code. 
            High-level programming languages (3rd gen lang): Things like python. 
            Database Languages (4th gen lang): "What, not how" Languages where you specify what you want and now how to do it. Think SQL. 
        Begin discussion on databases and relational algebra. Basic intro to SQL. 
        For our cases, we're representing tables as lists of dictionaries. Each row is a dictionary. 
        Select takes 2 arguments [Table_Name, Unary_Predicate (one-argument function, output is true or false)] for our cases UP could be a lambda function or a traditional python function. ex. of concept select(movies, lambda movie_dict:movies["director"]=="George Lucas")
    11/17: 
        Quiz 21: Covers Select.  
        Note that our list of dictionaries tolerates duplicates, while things like SQL do not. Ideally, we'd use a dictionary of dictionaries, but we can't in python because that's not hashable. 
        Exercise: project.py
            project(table, *series of attributes) <- returns table with all rows, but only the listed columns. 
        Exercise: CrossJoin.py 
            crossjoin(table1, table2) <- Combine the two tables by combining each of the rows [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,1],[2,2] etc. 
        Exercise: ThetaJoin.py
            thetajoin(table1, table2, up) <- Combine the two tables when the unary (binary) predicate is true. (Up takes two arguments, row1 and row2)
