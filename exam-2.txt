Test # 2
Test #2 will be on Thu, 3 Dec, during class time and via Canvas.

The test will be published, like a quiz and you have 75 minutes to finish and submit the test.

It is closed book, but one page of notes (8 1/2 x 11) is allowed. The page of notes can be double sided and printed in any way.

You are not allowed to use your computing machines to test your code.

We will NOT use proctoring tools, but you need to join the class turn on the camera of your computing machine.

The test may consist of questions related to the assignments, classwork, and project 2.

The test will be mainly code writing and will cover Python, Relational Algebra, JSON, and RegEx.

For each question, there will be a textbox for you to provide the answer.

You should be familiar with the following:

Python: 
    Lambdas:
    Closures:
    decorators:
    iterator functions:
    iterator classes:
    RegEx:

Relational Algebra: 
    select:
    project: 
    cross join:
    theta join:
    natural join:

Data-interchange format: 
    XML:
    JSON:

You should also be familiar with the concepts that were introduced before test #1 (except for the assigned readings).

The best way to study is to form a study group.

Good luck.
